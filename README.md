# Automatically Deploy Generative AI Go with Genkit Web Application to Cloud Run

Deploying a web application for the first time can be intimidating. This project demonstrates how to streamline the deployment process with **continuous deployment**, enabling automatic deployment of your application to Cloud Run whenever changes are made to the source code.

## Overview

In this project, you will:
- **Write a web application** using Cloud Shell Editor.
- **Store your application code** in a GitHub repository.
- **Automatically deploy** your application to Cloud Run using version control.
- **Integrate Generative AI** into your application with **Genkit**.
- **Manage LLM prompts** efficiently using the **dotprompt** library.

## Features

- **Continuous Deployment**: Automate deployments to Cloud Run directly from your GitHub repository.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Utilize Genkit to enhance your application with AI capabilities.
- **Prompt Management**: Simplify and manage Large Language Model (LLM) prompts with dotprompt.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) project with billing enabled.
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- Basic knowledge of web development and cloud services.

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Write the Application**: Use the Cloud Shell Editor to build a web application.
2. **Version Control**: Push your application code to a GitHub repository.
3. **Cloud Run Setup**: Configure Cloud Run to deploy changes automatically when updates are pushed to the repository.
4. **Generative AI Integration**:
   - Install and integrate **Genkit** into your application.
   - Use the **dotprompt** library to manage prompts for LLM interactions.

### Deployment
- Any changes pushed to your GitHub repository will trigger an automatic build and deployment to Cloud Run.
- Modify your application code, commit the changes, and see your updates live in minutes.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Google Cloud Run**: A fully managed compute platform for running containers.
- **Genkit**: A toolkit for adding Generative AI capabilities to your applications.
- **dotprompt**: A library for managing prompts in LLM-based applications.

## Learnings
- Write scalable web applications.
- Automate deployment processes with continuous deployment.
- Enhance applications with AI-powered features.
- Efficiently manage AI prompts for better performance and maintainability.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more LLMs and additional prompt management features.
- Extend the application to support additional deployment platforms.
